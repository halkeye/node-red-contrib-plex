# Plex connection for Node-Red

This module makes a connection with a Plex server to retrieve information about the current media.
It could be used to control lights or scenes based on the play state or the current playing media.
 
This module uses [node-plex-api](https://github.com/phillipj/node-plex-api) for the communication with Plex.

## Contributions and improvements
Contributions and improvements are always welcome, I'm just someone who wanted to use Plex in Node-Red, 
so please correct me or improve this package if possible.
